        "Welcome to the landing page of my website. This is a work in progress that I started at the beginning of the summer of '24 and am now starting to pick
        up again. It started because of my desire to learn some more about the internet and different computer languages, as well as to have a place
        to house what I am working on."
    </p>

    <p>I have also always been a fan of these super simple old school websites, and always wanted to make my own.
        Some of the best information I have founf for my classes has come from these pages and I wanted to keep them alive.
