        This website is one of my first projects, atleast the first that I have actually put out anywhere.
        I wanted to make this website because at the time I was watching a lot of youtube videos about Linux 
        and just general computer/internet information, and I thought this would be a cool super basic web development
        project that would also serve as a place to house things I have done and aim to do.
